Installation rtcapp starting from a freshly installed windows 10
================================================================

- install (64bit) python3 from
    https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
  Use python 3.8 for the moment!
    (otherwise matplotlib wil have to be created from source)

- To test python, start a simple main.py program via the Idle IDE.

- via the commandline:
    - extend the Path so that python en pip can be found directly
        AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python38-64
        AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python38-64/Scripts

- Install the following python modules using pip3 command
    - matplotlib (3.1.x), PyYAML, pyqt5, scipy, pylatex, openpyxl, mplcursors, pyperclip
    - when a version is mentioned use the newest version from that series, e.g.
         pip install matplotlib==3.1.3
    - find available versions using
         pip install matplotlib==rubbish
      with the newest version of pip you have to use:
         pip install matplotlib== --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver

    - you can find all modules that are installed using
         pip3 list

    
- Install latex, see https://www.latex-project.org/get
  This is a document preparation system that is used for scientific publications,
  especially in the beta sciences. Needed to create the reports.
      
  It is optionally in the sense that the program works without it, only the report
  is not created.

- Install perl, needed for report generation by MikTex
  Install from
    http://strawberryperl.com/

- Basic testing
    - Command:  python tstqtquick.py
       - yields a yellow window
    - Command:  pythong tstmatplotlib.py
       - a simple plot
    - Command:  pdflatex tstlatex.tex
       - tests creating a pdf file
    Really do this before proceeding!
    
- De RtcNoordApp can be found at
    https://github.com/SietseAchterop/RtcNoordApp.git
  Download using the zipfile (or git).
    
- start the rtcapp via the command line
  - change directory to RtcNoordApp/App directory
      python3 main.py
    We can see the errors in the terminal.
- start via python Idle IDE

- start via desktop
    Create a shortcut on the Desktop to the pythonw.exe program. Note, NOT python.exe.
    Open the properties of the shortcut.
    Add the parameter main.py to the Target. In my case it became:
         C:\Users\rtc\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\pythonw.exe main.py
    Set the "Start in" value to the App directory where main.py resides.
    Now the App can be started directly from the desktop.

Using video (optional)
======================

- mpv en libmpv  (https://mpv.io/)
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/
      mpv-x86_64-2020....
      mpv-dev-x86_64-2020...
    put in ~/Software/mpv en ~/Software/libmpv
    install mpv

- the file mympv.py is a recent version from the package python-mpv
    In (the beginning of) mympv.py the absolute pad to mpv-1.dll is changed:
      if os.name == 'nt':
          dll = ctypes.util.find_library('/Users/rtc/Software/libmpv/mpv-1.dll'))

Using Git (optional)
====================

- install Git
     https://git-scm.com/download/win
     includes bash en many basic utilities!

- Retrieve the app from github to, say, your homedir.
    git clone https://github.com/SietseAchterop/RtcNoordApp.git
    
    Add Scripts directory to PATH of GITbash
       for use of pip

Installing with anaconda
=========================

- install anaconda3 via installer
- start navigator, select enviroment
  - create and select new environment (myenv)
  - add channel conda-forge to channels
  - update/install
       pyqt5 (5.12.3), pyyaml, numpy, scipy, matplotlib (3.1.3)

- start powershell in myenv
  - install pylatex via pip

- create links to powershell(myvenv) and spider(myenv) on Desktop.

- To directy start the app from the Desktop
    open properties of the powershell link above.
      Add the following to the end of Target:
          python main.py
      So:
        .. myenv'; python main.py "

- Install MikTeX and mpv as above
