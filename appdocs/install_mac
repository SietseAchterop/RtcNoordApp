Installatie rtcapp op een Mac
=============================

- MacOS 10.12 or higher is needed because we use Qt 5.12.

- install python3 from
    https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

- start python
     - via Idle (a simple development environment) or the commandline for a Terminal.
     - python versie 2 is probably still the default, if so, use the command python3.
     - If you want to do something with python and are new to it, be sure to shortly look at Idle!

- To install python libraries, use the pip command from the commandline.
    - Maybe you need to use the pip3 command
    - To show which libraties are already installed use:
       pip3 list
          
- Install the following python modules using pip3 command
    - matplotlib (3.1.x), PyYAML, pyqt5, scipy, pylatex, openpyxl, mplcursors, pyperclip
    - when a version is mentioned use the newest version from that series, e.g.
         pip3 install matplotlib==3.1.3
    - find available versions using
         pip install matplotlib==
      with the newest version of pip you have to use:
         pip install matplotlib== --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver
    - you can find all modules that are installed using
         pip3 list
    
- Install latex, see https://www.latex-project.org/get
  This is a document preparation system that is used for scientific publications,
  especially in the beta sciences. Needed to create the reports.
      
  It is optionally in the sense that the program works without it, only the report
  is not created.
- Basic testing
    - Command:  python tstqtquick.py
       - yields a yellow window
    - Command:  pythong tstmatplotlib.py
       - a simple plot
    - Command:  pdflatex tstlatex.tex
       - tests creating a pdf file
    Really do this before proceeding!
    
- De RtcNoordApp can be found at
    https://github.com/SietseAchterop/RtcNoordApp.git
  Download using the zipfile (or git).
    
- start the app via python in a Terminal (command window)
  - change  directory to RtcNoordApp/App
     python3 main.py
  This starts the app and shows warning/errors in the terminal window.

- start via python Idle IDE
  This also shows the warnings/errors

- start via desktop
    Read and use the script RtcNoord.command


Using video (optional)
======================

- We use a program called mpv, see https://mpv.io/
  The program mpv is for displaying multimedia files.
  The library libmpv is used from within our app to control display a video.

- https://mpv.io/installation
  The MacOS version are unsupported.
  Not tested yet.

- The file mympv.py in the app is a recent version from python-mpv that we use with a small patch.
    We need to set the absolute path to the library,
    Here the version for Windows.
      if os.name == 'nt':
          dll = ctypes.util.find_library('/Users/rtc/Software/libmpv/mpv-1.dll')

Using Git (optional)
====================

- install Git
     https://git-scm.com/download/win
     including bash and linux utilities

- Retrieve the app from github
    git clone https://github.com/SietseAchterop/RtcNoordApp.git
    Maybe put it in your home directory
    
    Put Scripts directory in path of GITbash to get access to commands like pip3 etc.
       bijv. voor pip

Using Anaconda
==============

As an alternative to using python you could use Anaconda/spider, a more advanced IDE
for python, but installing is more complicated. Only relevant if you already use it!
