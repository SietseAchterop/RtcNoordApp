currently using qtquick2 backend from
   https://github.com/jmitrevs/matplotlib_qtquick_playground

-  works both on PyQt5 and PySide2
-  use private _mouseover_set function to avoid warnings
-  added qmlGetFigure property to get the Figure over from qml back to python
-  downgraded the qml examples to 2.12 to match what we do in the app
