Installation rtcapp starting from a freshly installed windows 10
================================================================

- If you are already using anaconda/spider, then see the section below.

- install (64bit) python3 from
    https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

- To test, start a simple main.py program via the Idle IDE.

- via the commandline:
    - extend the Path so that python en pip can be found directly
        AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python38-64
        AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python38-64/Scripts

- using pip via the command line:
     try the following commands:
       pip list
       pip show pyqt5
       pip install pyqt5==rubbish
           (this shows the available versions of a package)

- pip install
    matplotlib==3.1.3, pyyaml, pyqt5, scipy, pylatex
       (hopefully 3.1.3 is temporary)

- apply matplotlib with diff_matplotlib  (probably not needed anymore)
    Changes 3 lines in the matplotlib sources
    Only removes unneeded errors/warnings on exiting.

- The RtcNoordApp can be found at:
    https://github.com/SietseAchterop/RtcNoordApp.git
    Download zip or clone with git, see below for git.
    
- Basic testing from docs directory:
    - Command:  python tstqtquick.py
       - yields a yellow window
    - Command:  python tstmatplotlib.py
       - shows a simple plot
    
- start the rtcapp via the command line
  - in Meten/RtcNoordApp/App directory
      python main.py
    We can see the errors in the terminal.
- start via python Idle IDE

- start via desktop
    Create a symbolic link on the Desktop from the file main.pyw


To create reports
==================
  Install latex, see https://www.latex-project.org/get   (MiKTeX)
    This is a document preparation system that is used for scientific publications,
    especially in the beta sciences.
  Test using tstlatex.tex which creates tstlatex.pdf
      pdflatex tstlatex.tex

  It is optionally in the sense that the program works without it, only the report
  is not created.

== Install perl
  Needed for report generation by MikTex
  Install from
    http://strawberryperl.com/
  Test with tstlatex.tex

Using video (optional)
======================

- mpv en libmpv  (https://mpv.io/)
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/
      mpv-x86_64-2020....
      mpv-dev-x86_64-2020...
    put in ~/Software/mpv en ~/Software/libmpv
    install mpv

- the file mympv.py is a recent version from the package python-mpv
    In (the beginning of) mympv.py the absolute pad to mpv-1.dll is changed:
      if os.name == 'nt':
          dll = ctypes.util.find_library('/Users/rtc/Software/libmpv/mpv-1.dll'))

Using Git (optional)
====================

- install Git
     https://git-scm.com/download/win
     includes bash en many basic utilities!

- Retrieve the app from github to, say, your homedir.
    git clone https://github.com/SietseAchterop/RtcNoordApp.git
    
    Add Scripts directory to PATH of GITbash
       for use of pip

Installing with anaconda
=========================

- install anaconda3 via installer
- start navigator, select enviroment
  - create and select new environment (myenv)
  - add channel conda-forge to channels
  - update/install
       pyqt5, pyyaml, numpy, scipy, matplotlib
         matplotlib version 3.1.3 (3.3?)

- start powershell in myenv
  - install pylatex via pip

- create links to powershell(myvenv) and spider(myenv) on Desktop.

- To directy start the app from the Desktop
    open properties of the powershell link above.
      Add the following to the end of Target:
          python main.py
      So:
        .. myenv'; python main.py "

- Install MikTeX and mpv as above
